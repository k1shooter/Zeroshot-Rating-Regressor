I really enjoyed the characters, plot etc.  Resurrections was entertaining, especially the idea of Neo caught in the matrix again as a creator of a game that was really his previous life.

through neil youngs album titles on the allmusic guide i made the grave mistake of thinking that this album and on the beach were a lot lighter than they were. here was my thought process as i remember it on the beach? hey beaches are fun! this record must be really happy! and with a lame title like that it must suck! well i was proven wrong on both counts as on the beach actually rules and is not even remotely happy. as for tonights the night well being in eighth grade at the time my natural reaction was oooh neils going to get some! go neil! go neil! wrong again. because this album is about drugs. specifically it is about the drug-related deaths of roadie bruce berry and crazy horse guitarist danny whitten. this inspired neil to write an album full of songs about death drugs his own fame and whatever else was pissing him off at the time. well he recorded it in 73 bur reprise records thought it was too depressing to release and instead put out on the beach which is not exactly an upbeat album itself. they finally deemed it worthy of release a couple years down the road. like its predecessor it tanked at the time but these days most people regard it as a landmark album. however i am not about to go as far as giving this a five-star score. it was up for consideration but there is a couple tunes here that flat-out blow and yeah both of them abandon the sloppy but hard-hitting barroom country-rock approach this album takes. borrowed tune is a solo piano and harmonica ballad that borrows its melody from the rolling stones lady jane neil even admits it in the last verse - yeah it is a good melody but would not you rather hear the original?i would. and then mellow my mind is actually a pretty satisfying concoction except neils vocals are so awful that the entire song gets fucked over for me. and while tired eyes one of the most popular songs here incidentally has great lyrics and a nice chorus i wish neil had bothered to sing the verses rather than speak them. would have been you know nice and stuff. other than that though... raw sloppy barrel house country-rock. it is not nearly as dark as i had expected it to be given its reputation - the classic title track is quite ominous but not much else is - but it is excellent anyway. i really dig the mix of crunchy guitar and pedal steel he works up on roll another number and albuquerque while world on a string lookout joe and especially come on baby let us go downtown are awesome ragged raw rockers that pretty much scream to be turned up and invite themselves to all kinds of headbanging. good good shit. my favorite song here? well we have got a three-way tie. both parts of the title song - the eerie country-inflected first and the more rock-oriented second - are classic. but i also love the shit out of come on baby let us go downtown probably because it is an up-tempo sing-along about buying drugs and i love a good bit of juxtaposition. and new mama is just creepy! an acoustic song with killer harmonies which i believe was meant for the aborted csny project human highway. it took me a while to realize how much i love it but i think it just might be the best song here. this is a lot of peoples favorite neil young record and while it is not quite mine it is still a very good one that i would recommend to all.\",\n          \"mark fisher notes late capitalism for all of

leading and exposing the public to mind expanding things often at a very early age this idea being mourned or spectrally revisited by many artists. burial represented this consciously echoeing nineties rave culture and sampling things that had once been euphoric and became elegiac. rave was a public option reasserting the value of collectivity while being quite pre-political. a communism of the emotions even with the ecstasy and such. why now is there so much pastiche? studiously replicating the past some critique of fukuyamas the end of history capitalism realism and mental health greatest achievement drawing from personal experiences. concepts from psychoanalyst david smail idea of magical voluntarism your fate in life is completely privatized in the sense that its your fault if you fail. positive thinking is the american religion misplaced guilt. irrational exuberance represented by secular anthems of empowerment dont stop believing firework no romance without finance essay neoliberal hijacking of consciousness raising into this hyper-individualist mode. a therapeutic narrative of heroic self transformation is the only story that makes sense in a world in which institutions can no longer be relied upon to support and nurture individuals therapeutic narratives is one way in which neoliberalism contained and privatized the molecular revolution that consciousness was raising. flip side proliferation of depression and bipolar disorder people are crushed by the inhospitable society. capitalism itself is a very bipolar system. contrary to what is taught in economics classes agents and entities are not rationally pursuing their objectives. the reality is that there are surges of belief that the economy will keep expanding and growing and then it collapses. it completely mimics the rhythms of depression and mania. possibly being reintroduced into the capitalist system. depressive hedonic behavior probably mainly bureaucracy. drugs now even drugs have become more pharmaceutical. move from collective drugs to more solipsistic and individual drugs.. the ruling ontology basically rules out the possibility of a social causation of mental illness because its very convenient for capitalism in the sense that its reinforcing capitalist drive towards itemistic individualization and secondly provides an enormously lucrative market in which multinational psychomafias can peddle their dodgy drugs.. connection - adam curtis lamentation for the decline of public institutions. interesting if maybe curtis and fisher were ever in contact. continued-- more mark fisher notes rap music hip hop has ambient textures now its on for a numbing effect. the lyrics still peddle a fantasy and it is interesting politically because it is at this stage prepolitical drakethe secret sadness of the 21st century. - the next step in raps dialectic raps consequence is having haters and ones who envy you but in addition to the being mentally ill and extremely sad is also an achievement of success. - trajectory of hip hop went from working class tales authenticity and rising stardom followed by the celebration of affluence. now it is this surge rappers taking xans and complaining about their wealth reflective of the culture at large. exiting the vampires castle 2013 - capitalism is seductive you can be your own master in life through willpower and magical voluntarism. especially the silicon valley style of it with the rock and roll disrupter image wild and free entrepreneur. taking risks gambling. my way by sinatra - of course the reality is much more like the book the organization man its these impersonal corporate structures and horrible bureaucracies. totally unromantic and impersonal. although... hip hop has somewhat earnestly added some glamour to capitalism. even films that disapprove of capitalism end up bolstering the ideology they claim to criticize inadvertently via antiheroes. argument in the tech sector a way to curb these massive digital platforms which largely manipulate this vampire castle reality we are all trapped in is that workersusers will own equity or a share of the platform. stupid bitches - leftist pile ons that are increasingly more vicious and self-defeating in nature. the internalization and outsourcing of the authoritarian impulse from a state apparatus to the individual. - and the left itself is really infected with the punitive solipsistic logic of neoliberalism even as they pro-port to be progressives. - its predicated on individualizing and privatizing all of the systemic structures. - fisher identifies a mechanism at work in leftist discourse where there is something that initially had very good motivations that one should respect other people and be aware of ones own privileges but seems to bring out tendencies towards puritanical and pietistic drives excommunicating people judging them harshly on things they say incorrectly. - as much as it tends to encourage a sort of fighting and factionalism and scheming one of the bigger problems is that its also based on an unreasonable idea of somehow being pure decontaminating themselves. but nobody has clean hands the hyper-vigilance is a divergence of energy and a reflex towards deflection! - people feel so hopeless to impact any real sources of oppression that they then police language and conduct. it gets quickly counter-productive. ironically marks text elicited this exact response got called a fascist online. his whole life was dedicated to anti-fascism. - the concept of class gets evacuated by all this focus on other forms of minority and identity. we must remember stubborn old fashioned commies who refer to climate concern and feminism as bourgeois concerns which is not what fisher is saying - mark only wanted to reinstate the centrality of class and of economic inequality as something which unites all of these different minorities. - the power of positive thinking and its negative analogue call out culture are both guilt driven mechanisms used to rationalize ones own privilege. - only through class consciousness can we mitigate sexism and racism a left that does not have class at its core can only be a liberal pressure group. fuck the left whatever. capitalist realism 2009 page 2 easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism - the widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system but also that is is now impossible to even imagine a coherent alternative to it. so bleak and painful but this futility is applicable to nostalgia and depression. - cites simon reynolds hip-hop cult of realness the hobbesian idea of a dog-eat- dog world is portrayed there. this is as good as it gets and you might be one of the few who win but everyone else will end up losers. and you will probably have to trample on some people to get to the top. - capitalist realism is saying that ruling ideologies will always naturalize themselves. this just is how things naturally are and therefor we must submit to them. - capitalism absorbs everything including the attempts at resisting it. which is sort of how nostalgia works also. zizeks concept anti-capitalism is an idea that is widely disseminated within capitalism. - politicians moved from being planners to being managers of the existing reality or maybe the aesthetic idealogical complex that legitimates the existing reality. fisher speaks on bureaucracy - the blarite new labor line did not eliminate bureaucracy it only decentralized it. ideological drives towards markets become imposed on things that functioned perfectly well before. the national health service television universities beaurocratic critique of academia this sort of conciliate proliferation of bureaucracy. the sheer amount of form filling and self-assessment and documentation that the persons of the lower echelons of academia must go through towards no end whatsoever. all some ideological imposition of an idea of how things could be made more competitive more thatcherite. referees market stalinism when factories would try to exceed their quotas through distortion inefficiencies and lies. - capitalism encourages misallocation. - the conceit of neoliberal leaders is their outsourcing of authoritarianism and fake opposition of institutional authority figures. positive thinking is usually an enforced lie sort of obvious counter-argument to reynolds ideas on insidious positive thinking is that sometimes the only way to make it through this is to delusionally convince oneself that you are destined for greatness. equally delusional problem bogus new slant towards mysticism might be a result of the lack of institutional nurture or support. witches astrology military vanguardism indirect action is represented always by the cultural generation of new narratives and perceptions - such ideas encourage a belief that new things are possible and change is possible. not retro-reenactment through puke-worthy eighties sci-fi style replicas\",\n          \"after an agonising four year wait that consisted of missed deadlines rumours woodworking and two

sea mist on pink  white kendrick lamar becomes oceans alter ego in skyline to and andre 3000 delivers one of his most fast paced verses on solo reprise. so is the hype deserved? definitely. with these 17 tracks ocean shows himself to be one of pops foremost innovators. blonde is a singular statement which can really stand it is own ground when given the opportunity and following channel oranges
